## HyBloglogy, a blog about hydoclimatalogy and it's impacts on society.




Hydroclimatology is the study of the relationships between climate and the hydrologic cycle. Climate anomalies, or the deviation of climate conditions from the norm, often result in hydrologic anomalies, that is a deficit or surplus of available surface water. In other words, droughts or floods.

You can find information about myself at the About Me. But briefly, I am a PhD student at the University of Montana in the Department of [Geosciences](http://hs.umt.edu/geosciences/). I work in [Dr. Marco Maneta's lab](http://www.umt.edu/hydro-econ-ag/), where I focus on the impacts of hydroclimatologic anomalies on agricultural production and food security. 

I created this blog for three primary reasons:

1. To start a discussion about my research and other related work. These are found at the Blog link in the lefthand menu.

2. Catalog projects that I have or am working on. These are found at the Projects link.

3. Create a repository of tutorials describing the technical aspects hydroclimatologic analysis. This includes examples of computer analysis techniques common to geospatial analysis. These are found in the Tech Repository link.

The blog is intended for anyone interested in hydrology, climate, and technology. I encourage anyone to join the discussions provided at the end of each post, or to contact me directly regarding questions or comments that I can use to improve the site.

I also hope that the technical repository will save my visitors some time Googling "How-Tos" on Stack Exchange by consolidating tutorials on using technology for hydroclimatologic and geospatial analysis. I work in Python on a Linux system, which is often neccessary to follow the tutorials. Note that I am not a computer scientist and have little formal training in computer programming. As such, my workflows are not always the most efficient, so I hope to receive feedback on how to improve the tutorials.

I hope you find the blog interesting!
