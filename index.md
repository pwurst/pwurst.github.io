## HyBloglogy 

### a blog about hydroclimatalogy and it's impacts on society.

**Hydroclimateology** is the study of the relationships between climate and the hydrologic cycle. Climate anomalies occur when climate conditions are different from the norm, and may result in a deficit or surplus of available water. In other words, droughts or floods.

**Drought** the most costly natural disaster to society, largely because our food production is so dependent on available water. The cost is beyond dollars, as communities may experience malnourishment or starvation due to drought.














I hope you find the blog interesting!
