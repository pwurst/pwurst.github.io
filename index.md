**Hydroclimateology** is the study of the relationships between climate and the hydrologic cycle. Climate anomalies occur when climate conditions are different from the norm, and may result in a deficit or surplus of available water. In other words, droughts or floods.

**Drought** is the most costly natural disaster to society, largely because our food production is so dependent on available water. The cost is beyond dollars, as communities may experience malnourishment or starvation due to drought.

**Technology** is a powerful tool for geospatial analysis and science communication, but is complex and constantly evolving.  

Check out the Blogs for posts about current research on drought and it's impacts on agriculture. The Projects include examples on using Python and other tools for geospatial analysis. 

I would very much appreciate feedback on how to improve the site. Blogs and projects will be updated based on your questions and comments. Know a better way to code a problem in the projects? Send me an e-mail! The site is in the beginning stage, so check back again soon!
