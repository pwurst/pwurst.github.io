Welcome to HyBloglogy, a blog about hydoclimatalogy and it's impacts on society.

Hydroclimatology is the study of the relationships between climate and the hydrologic cycle. Climate anomalies, or the deviation of climate conditions from the norm, often result in hydrologic anomalies, that is a deficit or surplus of available surface water. In other words, droughts or floods.

Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of Montana in the Department of [Geosciences](http://hs.umt.edu/geosciences/). I work in [Dr. Marco Maneta's lab](http://www.umt.edu/hydro-econ-ag/), where I focus on the impacts of hydroclimatologic anomalies on agricultural production and food security. 

I created this blog for three primary reasons:

1. To start a discussion about my research and other related work. These are found at the Blog link in the lefthand menu.

2. Catalog projects that I have or am working on. These are found at the Projects link.

3. Create a repository of tutorials describing the technical aspects hydroclimatologic analysis. These are found in the Tech Repository link.
