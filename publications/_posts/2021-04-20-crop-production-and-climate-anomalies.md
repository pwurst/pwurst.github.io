# Farmer Decisions on Crop Production Mitigates the Impact of Drought on Crop Yield 

## Summary:
Many studies about the impacts of drought on agriculture focus on understanding the impact of drought on crop yield. But this does not tell the entire story, because farmers can offset crop yield losses due to drought by increasing the planted area of a given crop, thus increasing the harvested area, which increases crop production. Here, crop yields are defined as the production per unit area (e.g., bushels per acre) while crop production is defined the total weight or volume of food produced (e.g., bushels, or bushels * the harvested area). Decreases in crop yield have been found to be more associated with droughts that persist for at around 3 months, while our research indicates that decreases in crop production are more associated with droughts which have persisted for 6 to 9 months or longer, which is longer than the growing season for many crops. This indicates that farmers mitigate the impact of drought on the total crop production by adjusting the planted area of a given crop, a decision made months before the growing season begins. So while yields may decrease due to drought, the total crop production decreases less because of farmer decision-making and land management.


## Implications
* **Informed decision making:** Farmers mitigate the impacts of drought on crop production by adjusting the planted area of a given crop when low crop yields are expected. 
* **Infrastructure is key:** Areas with irrigation infrastructure supplied by surrounding mountain snowpack provides a strong buffer against drought conditions. Farmers in the flatter Plains area do not enjoy this benefit because of lack of available mountain snowpack.
* **Climate not the only factor:** Price is a more important consideration for some crops than others when farmers are making decisions. Prices impact crops for livestock feed less than crops for human consumption. For example, wheat production is more sensitive to prices than alfalfa. 

## Problem
Droughts clearly have a negative impact on crop yields, where crop yields is defined as the mass or weight per unit area (e.g., bushels per acre). However, the impact of drought on crop production, defined as the total mass or weight of crop produced (e.g., bushels, tons) is less understood. Crop production is an important measure because it includes farmer decision-making, that is how much land to allocate to a given crop? For example, given the expectation of drought, a farmer could increase the cropping area to offset yield losses. The increase in cropping area might actually further decrease yield as cropping area is expanded into lower quality farming areas, yet production would increase.

However, drought is not the only consideration when understanding how farmers adjust crop production. Market conditions are also an important consideration. For example, a given crop might be expected to return higher yields during drought than an alternative crop, but the higher yielding crop may return a lower market value making the lower yielding crop more valuable. Therefore, the prices received by farmers for a given crop is an important consideration when determining the impact of drought on crop production. 

## Solution
We focused on the impact of drought on crop production rather than crop yield to understand how farmer decision-making changes the response of food production with respect to climate anomalies. We also considered the role that prices received by farmers under the assumption that farmers may choose to produce the more valuable crop even if that crop was more sensitive to drought. We focused on crop production around the Northern Great Plains region, specifically Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota. We considered alfalfa, barley, and winter wheat because these are important crops in the area. 

## Key Findings
*     Alfalfa production is more sensitive to drought than barley or winter wheat.
*     Farmers do not consider the prices of alfalfa when deciding how much alfalfa to grow. This is primarily due to the fact that alfalfa is a perennial crop with a field life of around 5 years, so farmers are less able to adjust the cropping area after the first year of planting.
