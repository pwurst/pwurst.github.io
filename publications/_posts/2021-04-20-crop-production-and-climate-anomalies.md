# Farmer Decision-making Mitigates the Impact of Drought on Crop Yield 

## Summary:
Many studies about the impacts of drought on agriculture focus on crop yield, or the crop produced per unit area. But this does not tell the entire story because farmers can offset crop yield losses during drought by increasing the planted area of a given crop at the beginning of the season, thus increasing the harvested area, thus increasing crop production (or total crop produced). Our research helped to fill in this gap by focusing on the impact of drought on crop production rather than crop yield. We also discuss how the affects of topography and irrigation might limit farmer decision-making in regards to crop production. Finally, we discuss that drought conditions are not the only factor that can impact crop production, and that the prices farmers receive for their produce is also plays a role in variability in crop production.

We focused on the crop production of alfalfa, barley, and winter wheat grown in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota at the county scale to determine if farmers mitigate the impacts of drought on yields by increasing crop production. The study area is advantageous because of differences in climate and topography between the western and eastern parts of the region. The western part of the region is generally comprised of wetter, cooler mountainous terrain where crops are primarily irrigated. The east is generally dryer, warmer, and flatter.

## Implications
* **Informed decision making:** Farmers mitigate the impacts of drought on crop yield by adjusting the planted area of a given crop when low crop yields are expected. 
* **Irrigation from mountain snowpack mutes the impact of drought:** Areas with irrigation infrastructure supplied by surrounding mountain snowpack provides a strong buffer against drought conditions. Farmers in the flatter Plains area do not enjoy this benefit because of lack of available mountain snowpack. Lack of irrigation limits decision making by farmers by limiting the available crops that can be grown during periods of drought.
* **Climate not the only factor:** Price is a more important consideration for some crops than others when farmers are making decisions. Prices impact crops for livestock feed less than crops for human consumption. For example, wheat production is more sensitive to prices than alfalfa. We posit that alfalfa is less tied to alfalfa prices because it is used for animal feed and so is more tied to animal prices and not crop prices.

## Motivation
Many studies have focused on the impacts of drought on crop yield, but we wondered if crop yields alone tells the whole story. Here, we make an important distinction: crop yields are defined as the production per unit area (e.g., bushels per acre, tonnes per hectare) and crop production is defined as the total weight or volume of food produced (e.g., bushels, tonnes). If we assume that, in most cases, farmers attempt to maximize crop yields given the climate condition, and so variability in crop yield is independent of farmer decision-making and is caused by climate anomalies. However, increasing the land that a farmer allocates to a given crop may compensate for losses in yield by increasing production. Or, a farmer may choose to grow a different crop altogether, perhaps a crop more resistant to drought.

We ask, can farmer-decisions regarding the amount of crop to produce mitigate the impacts of drought on crop yields?

## Our Findings

Droughts clearly have a negative impact on crop yield, which is defined as the mass or weight per unit area (e.g., bushels per acre). However, the impact of drought on crop production, defined as the total mass or weight of crop produced (e.g., bushels, tons) is less understood. Crop production is an important measure because it includes farmer decision-making, that is how much land to allocate to a given crop? For example, given the expectation of drought, a farmer could increase the cropping area to offset yield losses. The increase in cropping area might actually further decrease yield as cropping area is expanded into lower quality farming areas, yet production would increase.

We observed that crop production was more associated with droughts that persist over 7 to 9 months However, reductions in crop yield due to drought have been found to be more associated with droughts that persist for around 3 months (e.g., <cite>Zipper et al., (2016)</cite> and <cite>Pena-Gallardo (2019)</cite>). Therefore, crop yield responds more rapidly to drought than production, telling us that farmers are effectively mitigating the negative impacts of drought on crop yield through decisions-making. 

Farmers in the US generally purchase seed in the fall preceding the growing season, or months before the growing season begins. Assuming that farmers consider land allocation when making seed purchases, then farmers must have some expectation of crop yields months before the season begins, and they also must have some expectation of climate conditions for the following season when making their decisions about land allocation in the fall.

But this is not the case in all areas of our study. Crop production experienced less reductions in response to drought in the western portion of the study area crops are primarily irrigated from available mountain snowpack. Production experienced greater declines in response to drought in the flatter areas where irrigation is limited by lack of mountain snowpack. This indicated to us that farmers in more mountainous areas have more flexibility in their decision-making than
farmers in rain-fed areas. This might help policy makers and farmers better understand where to direct limited resources during times of drought.

Yet, drought is not the only factor that farmers may consider when deciding about land allocation and crop production. Market conditions are also an important consideration. For example, a given crop might be expected to return higher yields during drought than an alternative crop, but the higher yielding crop may return a lower market value making the lower yielding crop more valuable. Therefore, the prices received by farmers for a given crop is an important consideration when determining the impact of drought on crop production.  We observed that prices were most important for wheat, followed by barley, and least for alfalfa. We posit that the importance of market-prices varied by crop for several different reasons. Alfalfa is a perennial crop produces for around 5-7 years, limiting the ability of farmers growing alfalfa to change to another crop. Second, alfalfa is used as animal feed, while wheat is primarily used for human consumption. Barley is used for both human and animal consumption. Crops used for animal feed are likely more tied to livestock prices than the sale price of alfalfa.
